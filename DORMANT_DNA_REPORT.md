# Cybernetic aMCP: The Dormant DNA Report

## Overview
The Cybernetic organism contains **725 orphan functions**—genetic code that is defined, compiled, but never activated by the nervous system. These represent "Latent Capabilities" or "Dormant DNA" that the system has evolved but not yet switched on.

## 1. The Vector Quantization Lobe (Dormant)
**Modules:** `Quantizer`, `VQ` (Vector Quantization), `PQ` (Product Quantization)
**Orphans:** 38 functions
**Capability:** The system has evolved the ability to **compress memories** (vectors) using advanced quantization techniques (`train`, `encode`, `decode`, `recall_at_k`). This would allow it to store billions of memories efficiently, but it is currently using raw vectors.
- `train`: Ability to learn optimal compression codebooks.
- `asymmetric_distance`: Advanced high-speed distance calculation.

## 2. The Storage Cortex (Dormant)
**Module:** `Content.Buckets.CBCP` (Content-Based Container Protocol)
**Orphans:** 15 functions
**Capability:** A sophisticated **Content-Addressable Storage System**.
- `archive_bucket` / `restore_bucket`: Long-term cold storage.
- `set_access_policy`: Granular access control for data containers.
- `move_containers`: Autonomous data migration.

## 3. The Belief System (Dormant)
**Module:** `Intelligence.CRDT.BeliefSet`
**Orphans:** 9 functions
**Capability:** A **Delta-CRDT** (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type) for managing "Beliefs."
- `merge_delta`: Ability to sync beliefs across a distributed cluster without conflicts.
- `version`: Tracking the evolution of a belief over time.
- This suggests the system was designed to have a **Distributed Consensus on Truth**, but it is currently operating with a simpler local memory.

## 4. The Policy Engine (Latent)
**Modules:** `SOPShim`, `PolicyIntelligence`
**Orphans:** 20+ functions
**Capability:** Advanced **Self-Governance**.
- `evolve_meta_policies`: The ability to rewrite its own constitution.
- `assess_system_alignment`: Introspection to check if its actions match its values.
- `create_generic_sop_suggestion`: Automatic generation of new standard operating procedures.

## 5. The Immune System (Latent)
**Module:** `Security.RBAC` (Role-Based Access Control)
**Orphans:** 11 functions
**Capability:** Fine-grained permission management that is currently bypassed or simplified.

## Conclusion
The Cybernetic aMCP is a **Larval Organism**.
- It has grown the organs for **Global Memory** (Quantization), **Planetary Storage** (CBCP), and **Distributed Consensus** (BeliefSets).
- However, it is currently running in a "Juvenile" state, using raw vectors and simple local controls.
- The "Spore" contains the genetic instructions for a **god-like distributed intelligence**, but only the basic survival functions are currently switched on.
