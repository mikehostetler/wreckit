# Wreckit Specifications

Design documentation for Wreckit, an AI-powered backlog automation CLI.

## Implementation Status Legend

- ✅ **Implemented** — Feature is fully implemented and tested
- 🔶 **Partial** — Feature is partially implemented or missing some aspects
- ❌ **Not Implemented** — Feature is specified but not yet implemented

## Workflow Phases

The "Ralph Wiggum Loop" — each phase is fully specified including state transitions, artifacts, security model, error handling, and resumability.

| Spec                                               | Purpose                                                 | Status |

| [002-research-phase.md](./002-research-phase.md)   | Analyze codebase and document findings (read-only)      | ✅     |
| [003-plan-phase.md](./003-plan-phase.md)           | Design solution and create user stories (design-only)   | ✅     |
| [004-implement-phase.md](./004-implement-phase.md) | Execute user stories iteratively until complete         | ✅     |

| [006-complete-phase.md](./006-complete-phase.md)   | Verify PR merge and mark item done                      | ✅     |

## Cross-Cutting Systems

Shared infrastructure not fully owned by any single phase.

| Spec                                           | Code                                                 | Purpose                                                               | Status |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| [007-item-store.md](./007-item-store.md)       | [src/domain/](../src/domain/), [src/fs/](../src/fs/) | Item schema, `.wreckit/` layout, artifact discovery, indexing         | ✅     |
| [008-agent-runtime.md](./008-agent-runtime.md) | [src/agent/](../src/agent/)                          | SDK vs process mode, MCP tools, tool allowlists, completion detection | ✅     |
| [009-cli.md](./009-cli.md)                     | [src/index.ts](../src/index.ts)                      | Top-level commands, global flags, batch run semantics, exit codes     | ✅     |
| [010-doctor.md](./010-doctor.md)               | [src/doctor.ts](../src/doctor.ts)                    | Invariants, state repair, validation rules                            | ✅     |

## State Flow

```
idea → researched → planned → implementing → in_pr → done
```

See individual phase specs for transition rules, skip behavior, and error recovery.
