  "section": "features",
  "state": "idea",
  "overview": "Database queries through MCP are mocked, returning fake data. This prevents external systems from querying the Cybernetic platform's database through the MCP interface, limiting observability and integration capabilities.\n\n**Motivation:** External tools need to query the platform database for monitoring, analytics, and integration. The MCP interface is the standard way to expose this capability securely.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- execute_query/2 runs real SQL queries against configured database\n- Proper SQL injection prevention (beyond basic string replacement)\n- Connection pooling and timeout handling\n- Query result limits to prevent large result sets\n- Authorization checks for database access\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Must use existing Repo for tenant isolation\n- SQL injection prevention is critical\n- Query result size limits required\n- Must only allow read operations in production\n- Needs proper error messages\n\n**In scope:**\n- Implement execute_query/2 with Ecto.Repo.query\n- Add proper SQL sanitization\n- Implement connection pooling\n- Add query timeouts and result limits\n- Write security tests for SQL injection\n**Out of scope:**\n- Write operations (intentionally not allowed)\n- Database migrations (separate concern)\n- Multi-database support (single database only)\n\n**Signals:** priority: high, urgency: Security risk with mock data",
