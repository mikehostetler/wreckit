  "overview": "System3 Control Supervisor relies on placeholder functions that return mock data or have empty implementations. This prevents proper system health monitoring, intervention determination, and resource management.\n\n**Motivation:** System3 is the control layer of the VSM architecture. Without proper implementation of health monitoring and intervention logic, the system cannot self-regulate or maintain homeostasis.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- query_system_status/1 returns real system metrics\n- determine_health_status/1 analyzes actual health data\n- Intervention actions are properly executed\n- Resource limit policies are enforced\n- Telemetry tracks control actions\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Must integrate with telemetry/metrics system\n- Needs access to process and VM metrics\n- Control actions must be safe\n- Should not cause cascading failures\n\n**In scope:**\n- Implement query_system_status/1 with real metrics\n- Implement determine_health_status/1 with health rules\n- Add proper intervention execution\n- Implement resource limit checking\n- Write tests for control actions\n**Out of scope:**\n- System3 architecture (already exists)\n- VSM principles (documented elsewhere)\n- UI for monitoring (separate)\n\n**Signals:** priority: medium, urgency: System3 incomplete",
