  "overview": "Live audio streams are transcribed with placeholder text like '[Audio chunk N]' when the transcription service fails. This makes the live stream feature unusable for production use cases where real transcription is required.\n\n**Motivation:** Real-time transcription is a key feature for live stream processing. Without working transcription, the system cannot extract text from audio streams for analysis, search, or indexing.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Transcription service integration (OpenAI Whisper or similar)\n- Graceful fallback when service unavailable\n- Transcription quality metrics\n- Cost tracking for transcription API\n- Language detection support\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Must handle real-time audio chunks\n- Transcription latency must be low\n- API cost management required\n- Should support multiple languages\n- Error handling for audio quality issues\n\n**In scope:**\n- Integrate real transcription service (Whisper API)\n- Implement proper error handling\n- Add transcription cost tracking\n- Support multiple audio formats\n- Write tests with real audio\n**Out of scope:**\n- Audio processing pipeline (already exists)\n- Stream relay infrastructure (already exists)\n- Custom transcription model (use API)\n\n**Signals:** priority: medium, urgency: Live stream feature incomplete",
