  "overview": "MCP tool calls are failing with :not_implemented errors, preventing the system from leveraging external MCP tools and capabilities. This blocks integration with oh-my-opencode and other MCP-based services.\n\n**Motivation:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) is critical for extensibility and external tool integration. Without a functional Hermes client, the platform cannot communicate with external MCP servers, severely limiting its capabilities.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- call_tool/3 successfully invokes external MCP tools with proper error handling\n- read_resource/2 retrieves resources from MCP servers\n- Proper timeout handling and connection management\n- Integration tests pass with real MCP servers\n- Telemetry events emitted for all MCP operations\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing Plugin behavior\n- Should support stdio and websocket transports\n- Needs proper connection pooling and circuit breaking\n- Must handle OpenTelemetry trace propagation\n\n**In scope:**\n- Implement call_tool/3 in HermesClient\n- Implement read_resource/2 in HermesClient\n- Add connection management and health checks\n- Implement proper error handling and retries\n- Add comprehensive integration tests\n**Out of scope:**\n- Creating new MCP tools (that's separate)\n- MCP server implementation (already exists)\n- Tool discovery (partially implemented)\n\n**Signals:** priority: high, urgency: Blocks oh-my-opencode integration",
