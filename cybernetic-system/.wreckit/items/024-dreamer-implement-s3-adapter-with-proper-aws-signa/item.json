  "section": "features",
  "state": "idea",
  "overview": "The S3 adapter lacks proper AWS signature v4 authentication, making it incompatible with real AWS S3 and S3-compatible services. This blocks production use of cloud storage for artifact storage.\n\n**Motivation:** Cloud storage is essential for scalable artifact storage. Without proper S3 authentication, the system cannot store artifacts in AWS S3, MinIO, or other S3-compatible services, limiting scalability.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Implements AWS Signature V4 authentication\n- Works with AWS S3 and S3-compatible services (MinIO, DigitalOcean)\n- Supports multipart uploads for large files\n- Proper error handling and retries\n- Configurable endpoint and region\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Must use ExAws or similar library\n- Needs proper credential management\n- Should support temporary credentials\n- Must handle S3-specific errors gracefully\n- Connection pooling required\n\n**In scope:**\n- Implement s3_put_object/1 with ExAws\n- Implement s3_get_object/1 with ExAws\n- Add proper authentication headers\n- Implement multipart upload support\n- Add integration tests with MinIO\n**Out of scope:**\n- Storage abstraction layer (already exists)\n- Local adapter (already exists)\n- Multipart upload orchestration (future enhancement)\n\n**Signals:** priority: high, urgency: Blocks cloud storage deployment",
