  "overview": "Critical system alerts, policy violations, and operational notifications cannot be sent via email. The email notification channel is non-functional, limiting the platform's ability to alert operators of important events.\n\n**Motivation:** Email notifications are a core operational requirement. Without functional email delivery, operators miss critical alerts, policy violations go unnoticed, and system reliability decreases.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Emails sent via Swoosh adapter\n- Supports multiple email providers (SendGrid, AWS SES, SMTP)\n- Template rendering for notification content\n- Delivery status tracking\n- Bounce and complaint handling\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Must use Swoosh library\n- Needs proper template rendering\n- Should support multiple providers\n- Delivery tracking required\n- Rate limiting to prevent blocking\n\n**In scope:**\n- Implement send_email_request/2 with Swoosh\n- Add email template rendering\n- Configure provider (SendGrid/SES/SMTP)\n- Add delivery tracking\n- Write integration tests\n**Out of scope:**\n- Notification channel management (already exists)\n- SMS or other channels (separate)\n- Email preference management (future)\n\n**Signals:** priority: medium, urgency: Operational alerting blocked",
