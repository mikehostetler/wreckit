  "overview": "Several integration and unit tests are skipped, including System2 coordinator tests, starvation tests, and multi-provider tests. This reduces confidence in the system and allows regressions in untested code paths.\n\n**Motivation:** High test coverage is critical for a distributed cybernetic system. Skipped tests represent gaps in validation and potential sources of bugs. Enabling these tests improves system reliability.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- All System2 tests run without skipping\n- Integration tests for multi-provider LLM routing\n- Starvation tests validate resource management\n- CI/CD runs full test suite\n- Test coverage above 80%\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Some tests require external services (LLM providers)\n- Need proper test fixtures and mocks\n- Tests should be fast enough for CI/CD\n- Must handle flaky integration tests\n\n**In scope:**\n- Unskip and fix System2 coordinator tests\n- Implement multi-provider integration tests\n- Fix starvation test assertions\n- Add test data fixtures\n- Document test requirements\n**Out of scope:**\n- Implementing the features being tested (separate)\n- Unit tests (those exist)\n- Performance tests (separate suite)\n\n**Signals:** priority: medium, urgency: Quality assurance gap",
