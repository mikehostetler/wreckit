  "overview": "User data sent to external LLM providers may contain PII (personally identifiable information), API keys, credentials, or other sensitive data. This violates privacy policies, GDPR requirements, and security best practices.\n\n**Motivation:** Redacting PII before sending data to external LLMs is critical for privacy compliance. Many industries have strict requirements about what data can leave their systems. This is a blocker for production deployment in regulated environments.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Detects and redacts common PII patterns (SSN, email, phone, credit card)\n- Redacts API keys and credentials\n- Supports tenant-specific redaction rules\n- Provides redaction audit log\n- Configurable sensitivity levels\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Must handle false positives carefully\n- Cannot break LLM prompt structure\n- Needs to support multiple data formats\n- Performance impact must be minimal\n- Redaction must be irreversible\n\n**In scope:**\n- Implement PII detection patterns\n- Add redaction logic that replaces with placeholders\n- Add tenant-specific rule configuration\n- Implement audit logging\n- Write tests with known PII patterns\n**Out of scope:**\n- ML-based PII detection (future enhancement)\n- Custom redaction strategies beyond basic patterns)\n- Data encryption (separate concern)\n\n**Signals:** priority: high, urgency: Privacy compliance requirement",
