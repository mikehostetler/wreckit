  "overview": "The Telegram Agent receives messages (Input confirmed via logs) but does not reply (Output confirmed working via manual script). The 'Reflex Arc' connects incoming messages to System 4 (Intelligence) and routes the response back to Telegram. Currently, messages enter the system and vanish into the void.",

  "motivation": "A silent bot is indistinguishable from a broken bot. We need immediate feedback (ACK) or processing to prove the system is alive.",
  "success_criteria": [
    "User sends 'hi' -> Bot replies (even if generic)",
    "Latency is minimal (<2s)",
    "Errors in processing loop are logged visibly"
  ],
  "technical_constraints": [
    "Must use existing TelegramAgent",
    "Must route through S1 -> S4 -> S1 if possible, or S1 -> Echo for testing"
