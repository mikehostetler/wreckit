# Fix Telegram Reflex Arc

## Status: COMPLETE

## Changes
1.  **Fixed Z.ai Integration:**
    -   Switched provider from `Anthropic` (which failed with Z.ai) to `OpenAI`.
    -   Configured correct `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (`https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4`).
    -   Verified connectivity with a probe script.

2.  **Fixed Telegram Routing:**
    -   Corrected argument order in `TelegramAgent.handle_cast` (was passing `text` as `chat_id` to routing logic).
    -   This prevented the "HTTP 400" error from Z.ai (which received a number instead of a string).

3.  **Fixed Message Handling:**
    -   Updated `MessageHandler.handle_intelligence` to return `{:ok, result}` instead of just `:ok`.
    -   Updated `AMQPConsumer` to correctly inspect the `result` map and format it for Telegram.

4.  **Verified:**
    -   Bot successfully replies to "hi" with a coherent response generated by GLM-4.
    -   "Acknowledged" debug messages removed.
