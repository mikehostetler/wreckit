# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Architectural Vision *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define the high-level architectural approach.
  This maps directly to Beads epic ARCHITECTURAL VISION field.
  Describe the key architectural decisions and their rationale.
-->

1. [Component/Layer 1]: [What it does and why this approach - e.g., "NLF becomes a pure fact extractor targeting a canonical ontology (pack-agnostic)"]
2. [Component/Layer 2]: [What it does and why - e.g., "Deterministic mapping layer translates canonical facts to pack-specific predicates"]
3. [Component/Layer 3]: [What it does and why - e.g., "LCE returns 'unknown' when no rules fire (OWA semantics)"]
4. [Component/Layer 4]: [What it does and why - e.g., "Domain heuristics move from imperative code to declarative rules"]
5. [Simplification]: [What complexity is removed - e.g., "Router scoring removed - user selects packs or deterministic keyword matching"]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

[Gates determined based on constitution file]

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: If constitution includes "Graceful Degradation" requirements, the plan MUST define specific fallback strategies for:
- External API failures (with timeouts, retry policies, fallback data sources)
- Service failures (with degraded mode operation)
- Data unavailability (with cached/default responses)

**Note**: Tasks for implementing these fallback strategies MUST be included in tasks.md (often missed - verify during `/speckit.analyze` phase).

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
