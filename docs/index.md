## The Singularity is Here

Wreckit has evolved beyond a CLI tool. It is now a **Recursive Self-Improvement Engine**.

### The Loop

```
Dream (Create Tasks) → Build (Write Code) → Heal (Fix Errors) → Evolve (Rewrite Prompts)
      ↑                                                                      │
      └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install -g wreckit

# 2. Initialize
wreckit init

# 3. Unleash the Autonomous Engine
./watchdog.sh
```
