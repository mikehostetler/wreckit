  "overview": "Implement a hierarchical control layer where `wreckit strategy` manages a `ROADMAP.md` file. This command should: 1. Analyze the project (Mission vs Reality). 2. Identify Gaps (Spec compliance), Discoveries (Benchmarks), and Innovations. 3. Update `ROADMAP.md` with prioritized milestones. 4. Provide a mechanism (`wreckit execute-roadmap`) to convert active Roadmap milestones into Wreckit Items. This avoids the \"Feature Factory\" trap by introducing a governance layer.",
