  "overview": "Type 'any' used for sdkOptions in claude-sdk-runner.ts line 32 eliminates type checking for critical SDK configuration, potentially allowing invalid options to pass silently.\n\n**Motivation:** Proper typing ensures compile-time validation of SDK options, better IDE autocomplete, and prevents runtime errors from misspelled or invalid options. Using 'any' defeats TypeScript's primary benefit.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- sdkOptions properly typed using SDK types\n- No 'any' types in agent runner files\n- Type safety validated with TypeScript strict mode\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Must identify correct SDK option types from @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk\n- Should not break existing functionality\n- May need to augment SDK types if incomplete\n\n**In scope:**\n- Replace 'any' type with proper SDK types\n- Validate all option properties are typed\n- Ensure type safety for MCP servers and tools\n**Out of scope:**\n- Refactoring SDK integration architecture\n- Changes to SDK package usage patterns\n- Modifying error handling\n\n**Signals:** priority: medium, urgency: Type safety issues can cause runtime errors with SDK options",
