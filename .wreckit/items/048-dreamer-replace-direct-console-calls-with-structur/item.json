  "state": "done",
  "overview": "Direct console output calls bypass the structured logging system, creating inconsistent log formatting and making it difficult to control log levels or aggregate logs effectively.\n\n**Motivation:** Using a structured logging system (already in place via logger) ensures consistent log formatting, proper log levels, and enables features like log aggregation and filtering. Direct console output creates inconsistent logging.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- All console calls replaced with logger methods\n- Consistent log formatting maintained\n- Log levels properly used (info, warn, error, debug)\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Must maintain existing output behavior for user-facing commands\n- Should not break existing log formatting\n- Need to ensure logger is available in all contexts\n\n**In scope:**\n- Replace console.log/warn/error in src/commands/show.ts\n- Replace console calls in src/commands/phase.ts\n- Replace console calls in src/doctor.ts\n- Audit other files for direct console usage\n**Out of scope:**\n- Refactoring the entire logging architecture\n- Changes to log aggregation systems\n- Modifying logger implementation\n\n**Signals:** priority: low",
