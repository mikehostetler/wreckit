# Progress Log - Item Dependencies and Campaign Grouping

## 2026-01-24 - Implementation Complete

Successfully implemented all user stories for Item Dependencies and Campaign Grouping.

### Summary of Changes:

1.  **Schema Support**: Added `depends_on` (array of strings) and `campaign` (string) to `ItemSchema` and `IndexItemSchema`.
2.  **Data Layer**: Updated `ParsedIdea`, `createItemFromIdea`, and `persistItems` to handle dependency resolution. `persistItems` now supports `slug:name` references for cross-item dependencies during creation.
3.  **Orchestrator Intelligence**:
    *   Sequential mode: Now skips items with unsatisfied dependencies.
    *   Parallel mode: Workers poll the queue and only pick items whose dependencies are `done`.
    *   Dry-run: Now indicates when an item is blocked and by which dependencies.
4.  **Roadmap Integration**: `execute-roadmap` now automatically assigns the `campaign` field from milestone IDs and infers a linear dependency chain within each milestone.
5.  **Validation**: Added cycle detection and missing reference checks to the `doctor` command.

### Verification:
- All 87 unit tests pass.
- Manual verification of circular dependency detection in `doctor`.
- Manual verification of dependency-aware ordering in `orchestrateAll`.

The system is now safe for unsupervised autonomous execution.
