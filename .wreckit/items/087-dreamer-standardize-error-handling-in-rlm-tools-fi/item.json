  "title": "[DREAMER] Standardize error handling in RLM tools file operations",
  "state": "idea",
  "overview": "The RLM tools contain extensive comments (lines 102-174) discussing the trade-offs between local and remote file operations. The code has a TODO comment and shows evidence of multiple refactoring attempts. The current strategy uses local FS with bi-directional sync, but the comments suggest this may not be ideal.\n\n**Motivation:** Clear, consistent file operation strategy is critical for RLM reliability. The extensive comments and TODO indicate this is a source of confusion or technical debt. A clean, well-documented implementation would reduce maintenance burden and prevent bugs.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Resolve TODO comment at line 102\n- Remove or consolidate extensive comment discussion\n- Document the chosen strategy (local vs remote) clearly\n- Ensure Read/Write tools are consistent in their approach\n- Add error handling for sync failures\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Depends on the Sprite VM sync mechanism\n- Must maintain compatibility with existing RLM workflows\n- Changes must not break remote execution\n\n**In scope:**\n- src/agent/rlm-tools.ts:102 TODO comment\n- src/agent/rlm-tools.ts:137-167 Write tool implementation\n- src/agent/rlm-tools.ts:172-174 Read tool override\n- Documentation of the chosen file operation strategy\n**Out of scope:**\n- Refactoring the entire RLM architecture\n- Changes to the Sprite sync mechanism\n\n**Signals:** priority: medium, urgency: Technical debt - confusing implementation with TODO",
