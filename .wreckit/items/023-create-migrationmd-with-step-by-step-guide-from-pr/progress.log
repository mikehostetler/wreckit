# Progress Log: Create MIGRATION.md

## 2025-01-24 - Implementation Complete

### Stories Completed

- **US-001**: Created MIGRATION.md with complete migration guide (~479 lines)
  - All required sections present (Overview, Quick Migration, Configuration Reference, Environment Variables, Verification, Fallback Behavior, Troubleshooting, Staying on Process Mode)
  - All 14 JSON configuration examples validated as syntactically correct
  - Document follows existing README.md style

- **US-002**: Verified all links resolve correctly
  - README.md:208 links to ./MIGRATION.md
  - CHANGELOG.md:35, 45, 67 link to ./MIGRATION.md
  - Internal links in MIGRATION.md (to README.md, AGENTS.md, CHANGELOG.md) all use relative paths and files exist

- **US-003**: Verified MIGRATION.md included in npm package
  - package.json:14 already lists MIGRATION.md in files array
  - `npm pack --dry-run` confirms MIGRATION.md (10.3kB) is included
  - `bun run build` completes successfully

### Key Learnings

1. The migration documentation was already referenced in 4 places (README.md, CHANGELOG.md x3, package.json) but the file didn't exist
2. Environment variable precedence is well-documented in src/agent/env.ts and needs to be exposed to users
3. The `wreckit sdk-info` command is a powerful diagnostic tool that should be prominently featured
4. Automatic fallback from SDK to process mode is a key migration safety feature

### Files Changed

- Created: `MIGRATION.md` (479 lines)
