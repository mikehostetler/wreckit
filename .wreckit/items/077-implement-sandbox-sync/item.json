  "title": "Implement Sandbox Project Synchronization",
  "section": "infrastructure",
  "state": "done",
  "overview": "Automatically synchronize the current project's code into the Sprite VM when starting a Sprite Agent session. This solves the 'Empty Box Problem' by ensuring the agent has access to the codebase it is meant to work on.",
  "problem_statement": "Currently, Sprite VMs start empty. An agent running inside cannot access or modify the user's project files, making it useless for refactoring or testing tasks.",
  "motivation": "To enable 'Clean Room' development where agents can build, test, and refactor the actual project in a safe, isolated environment.",
  "success_criteria": [
    "Project files are compressed (tar.gz) respecting .gitignore",
    "Bundle is uploaded and extracted into the Sprite VM at startup",
    "Agent starts in the synced directory",
    "node_modules and .git are excluded to speed up transfer",
    "Sync happens automatically in `runSpriteAgent`"
  ],
  "technical_constraints": [
    "Must be performant (avoid transferring GBs of dependencies)",
    "Must use existing `execSprite` primitive (no new binaries)",
    "Must handle binary data correctly during upload"
  ],
  "scope_in_scope": [
    "src/agent/sprite-runner.ts",
    "src/fs/sync.ts"
  ],
  "scope_out_of_scope": [
    "Two-way sync (pulling changes back is a future item)",
    "Real-time file watching/syncing"
