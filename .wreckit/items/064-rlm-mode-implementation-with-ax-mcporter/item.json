  "overview": "Wreckit currently supports only Direct execution via various SDK runners. We need to add a more sophisticated reasoning loop mode that can handle complex tasks through iterative think-act-observe cycles.\n\n**Motivation:** Enable Wreckit to solve more complex coding tasks by leveraging a ReAct agent pattern. This provides better tool orchestration and reasoning capabilities compared to direct execution.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- RlmRunner implements the Wreckit Agent interface\n- Can load and use built-in tools as AxFunctions\n- Can load and proxy MCP servers via mcporter\n- Agent can execute tasks using ReAct pattern with configurable max iterations\n- CLI can select RlmRunner when requested via command or flag\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Must use @ax-llm/ax as the ReAct agent framework\n- Must use mcporter for MCP server proxying\n- Must integrate with existing Wreckit Agent/Runner interface\n- Must support multiple AI providers via AxAI configuration\n- Must work with bun runtime\n\n**In scope:**\n- Create new RlmRunner class in src/agent/rlm-runner.ts\n- Implement MCP client adapter using mcporter\n- Expose builtin tools for agent use\n- Register rlm command/flag in CLI\n- Map Wreckit config to AxAI config\n- Support both built-in and MCP-provided tools\n\n**Signals:** priority: high, urgency: New feature implementation, no explicit timeline stated",
