  "title": "Integrate Wisp/Sprites Go Stack",
  "section": "infrastructure",
  "state": "done",
  "overview": "Integrate with Wisp (Sprite session manager), WebTmux, and the Sprites Firecracker platform. This allows Wreckit to orchestrate isolated microVM environments, spawning agents inside them for secure, sandboxed execution.",
  "problem_statement": "Wreckit currently runs locally. For dangerous or complex tasks, we need isolated, disposable environments. The Go stack (Wisp/Sprites) provides this capability.",
  "motivation": "To enable 'Sandbox Mode' where agents run in Firecracker VMs, accessible via WebTmux, managed via Wisp CLI.",
  "success_criteria": [
    "New `wreckit sprite` CLI command group (start, attach, list, kill)",
    "New `SpriteRunner` that wraps `wisp` CLI interactions",
    "RLM tools (`spawn_sprite`, etc.) exposed to agents",
    "Configuration support in `.wreckitrc`/`config.json`",
    "Integration tests mocking the Wisp CLI"
  ],
  "technical_constraints": [
    "Must shell out to `wisp` binary (do not rewrite logic)",
    "Must use `execa` or `child_process`",
    "Must integrate with existing RLM and Config systems"
  ],
