  "section": "maintenance",
  "state": "done",
  "overview": "The Code Archaeology report (Item 067) identified `src/git/index.ts` as a 1200+ line 'God Object' and a top technical debt hotspot. We will use the RLM agent to break this monolith into focused modules: `branch.ts`, `pr.ts`, `status.ts`, and `validation.ts`.",
  "branch": "wreckit/068-dogfood-rlm-refactor-git-monolith",

  "updated_at": "2026-01-27T20:00:00.000Z",
  "problem_statement": "`src/git/index.ts` is too large, hard to maintain, and serializes all operations via a global mutex. It violates the single-responsibility principle.",
  "motivation": "To prove RLM's capability to handle massive refactors (1200+ lines context) and to execute the strategic recommendations from the archaeology report.",
  "success_criteria": [
    "Split `src/git/index.ts` into at least 3 sub-modules",
    "Maintain 100% backward compatibility (exports)",
    "All git integration tests pass",
    "RLM agent performs the refactor autonomously"
  ],
  "technical_constraints": [
    "Must use `--rlm`",
    "Must verify using the existing git test suite"
