  "state": "critique",
  "overview": "Implement a recursive self-healing capability where the runtime can catch system errors (git locks, npm failures, invalid JSON) and spawn a specialized \"Doctor Agent\" to fix the environment and resume execution.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- **Error Interception:** Catch exit codes and stderr from agent processes.\n- **Doctor Skill:** A specialized skill set for environment repair (rm locks, npm install, json fix).\n- **Recursive Recovery:** The watchdog should not crash; it should pause, heal, and retry.\n\n**Motivation:** Demonstrated need during Campaign M4 where manual intervention was required for git locks and dependency issues.",
