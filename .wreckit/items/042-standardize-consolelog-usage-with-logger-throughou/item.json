  "overview": "Direct console usage in the domain layer bypasses the logging abstraction, preventing proper log level control and making testing difficult.\n\n**Motivation:** Consistent logging through the Logger interface enables proper log levels, output redirection in tests, and unified formatting across the codebase.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Replace all console.log/warn/error in domain/ with logger calls\n- Pass logger to functions that need it\n- All console usage removed from domain layer\n- Tests verify log output can be captured\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing output\n- Cannot change function signatures in public APIs\n- Logger interface already exists and should be used\n\n**In scope:**\n- Replace console.log in ideas-interview.ts with logger\n- Replace console.warn in indexing.ts with logger\n- Replace console.log in ideas-agent.ts with logger\n- Pass logger to domain functions that need it\n**Out of scope:**\n- Modifying the Logger interface\n- Changing logging in commands layer (already uses logger)\n- Adding new logging levels\n\n**Signals:** priority: medium",
