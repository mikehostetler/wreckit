You are an AI coding agent working on the repository `noahchristian/polymarket-aggregator`. Your task is to execute two specific tickets related to documentation and data modeling.

**Task 1: Document Helius API Integration Details (T-001)**
- Search the codebase to locate all files interacting with the Helius API.
- Extract code snippets showing how requests are made (parameters, headers, body).
- Identify the specific Helius endpoints and HTTP methods being used.
- Create a clear summary document of these findings.
- **CRITICAL:** Ensure all API keys, secrets, and sensitive credentials are fully redacted.

**Task 2: Generate Sample JSON Response for Token Data (T-002)**
- Identify the data structures (interfaces/types) defining a Token in the project.
- Generate a sample JSON object representing a token, populated with dummy data.
- Check if the token schema varies by type; if so, provide samples for each variation.
- Ensure all standard fields currently retrieved are included in the sample.

Please proceed by exploring the repository structure, fulfilling the acceptance criteria for both tickets, and outputting the necessary documentation and JSON samples.
